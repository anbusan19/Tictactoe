## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Smokey Animation Effect**: A black-and-white smokey animation effect for enhanced visual appeal.
- **Futurist Font**: The interface uses the Futurist font to give it a unique and stylish appearance.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against a friend in a two-player setup.

## How It Works

1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their mark ("X" or "O") in an empty cell.
3. The first player to align three marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game board and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game, including animations and the Futurist font.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.
